At least 2 raspberry pi's., a hub and at least one camera

the hub is wifi access point and bridge (if wired to ethernet)
assume the hub is the chartplotter running OpenCPN
it is also running a small website consolidating the cameras installed

assume the DNS hostname is chartplotter
assume that each camera has DNS host name such as Bowcam, MastCam, SternCam, PortCam, StarboardCam

ChartPlotter:5000/index.html is the home page
it will show a gallery of images from the remote cameras.

if you click on the image in the gallery, you open the remote camera controls
- take picture
- download picture
- future ---change mode from camera to video or back to camera


Remote Cameras (eventually) are named in .enveach camera will have a DNS name such as BowCam, MastCam, etc
    each camera is an endpoint
    the chartplotter will call endpoint to take-a-picture (updating static/LastImage.jpg)

   the chartplotter will show the last image taken in a Gallery
   example
        Bowcam:5000/static/LastImage.jpg
        Mastcam:5000/static/LastImage.jpg
        etc.
